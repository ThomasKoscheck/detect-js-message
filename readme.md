<h1>JavaScript Disabled Message</h1>
<p>This simple application displays a message to users who are viewing the page with JavaScript disabled, prompting them to enable it. Once JavaScript has been enabled, the message will disappear and users will be able to interact with the page.</p>
<p>Flexbox and <a href="https://github.com/daneden/animate.css">animate.css</a> have been used to add some flavour.</p>
